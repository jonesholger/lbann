# Neural Architecture Search

This directory contains LBANN implementations of NAS search spaces and search strategies. 
First in the series is [NASNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012)  search space with random (baseline) and [LTFB](https://lbann.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execution_algorithms/ltfb.html) search strategies.
It will eventually contain reference implementations of other search spaces and search strategies.
