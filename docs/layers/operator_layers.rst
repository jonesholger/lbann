.. _OperatorLayer:

----------------------------------------
OperatorLayer
----------------------------------------

OperatorLayer is composed of one or more operator objects. Operators
are applied sequentially.

Arguments:

   :ops: (``repeated Operator``)

:ref:`Back to Top<operator-layers>`

________________________________________


.. _Operator:

----------------------------------------
Operator
----------------------------------------

Operator is the base class for LBANN operators

Arguments:

   :input_type: (``lbann.DataType``) The type expected as input

   :output_type: (``lbann.DataType``) The type expected as output

   :device: (``lbann.device_allocation``) The device allocation

Methods:

   :export_proto(): Get a protobuf representation of this object

   :do_export_proto():

      Get a protobuf representation of this object

      Must be implemented in derived classes
